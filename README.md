# TeamCityTestProject

## Overview
TeamCityTestProject is a Maven-based Java project that includes a suite of automated tests for TeamCity. It leverages several libraries and tools such as Selenide for browser automation, Rest-Assured for API testing, and Allure for reporting. This project is configured to run tests using TestNG and generate detailed reports with Allure.

## Teamcity Project Setup using the Teamcity server
You can use the TeamCity server offered through the following link: https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/signup/.
Use Gitlab/Githab/Bitbucket/Google account for the remote server with DB creation. 

## Teamcity Project Setup using the Docker
To set up a TeamCity server using Docker, you can follow these steps.
The TeamCity server Docker image is available on Docker Hub, which makes it easy to get started.

## Install Docker
If you haven't already installed Docker, download and install it from the official Docker website https://www.docker.com/ .

## Pull the TeamCity Server Docker Image
You can pull the latest TeamCity server image from Docker Hub. As of now, you can use the `jetbrains/teamcity-server` image.

```
docker pull jetbrains/teamcity-server
```

## Run the TeamCity Server Container
Now, you can start the TeamCity server using the following command. This command will run the TeamCity server in a Docker container and map the necessary ports:
```
docker run -it --name teamcity-server -v teamcity_data:/data/teamcity_server/datadir -v teamcity_logs:/opt/teamcity/logs -p 8111:8111 jetbrains/teamcity-server
```

* -it: Runs the container interactively.
* --name teamcity-server: Names the container teamcity-server.
* -v teamcity_data:/data/teamcity_server/datadir: Mounts the teamcity_data volume to the TeamCity data directory.
* -v teamcity_logs:/opt/teamcity/logs: Mounts the teamcity_logs volume to the TeamCity logs directory.
* -p 8111:8111: Maps port 8111 on your host machine to port 8111 in the container (TeamCityâ€™s default web interface port).

## Access the TeamCity Web UI

Once the container is running, you can access the TeamCity web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8111` in your web browser.


## Automation Project Setup
